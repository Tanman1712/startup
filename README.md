# Html Stuff
The Html Introduction has a table of all the different divisions and special characters

# AWS Route 53
My domain name is wouldyourather.click
Not much else of import

# AWS EC2 Server
Line of code used to ssh (starting from home directory). ssh -i ./Documents/CS\ 260/production.pem ubuntu@18.119.143.2

I used gitbash for the ssh, maybe try to get it to work on vscode?

I did the elastic IP thing so now my IP address is **3.128.75.219**. Keep this in mind for the ealier ssh line of code.
**Yeah, looks like the old ip doesn't work anymore.**

***Important Reminder!
Make sure to remove the elastic when I terminate the server at the end of the semester!!!!!***

**The Pitch**
Here's the pitch. I want to create a Would You Rather application that updates after each person who uses it. That way, after someone picks a choice it can show percentage of people who chose each answer. I can even put how many people have answered so that there's more context behind the percentages. I want the app to only progress through the questions (no returning to a previous) or at least not allow users to change answers. At the end I want a free response question where people have the option to add a new would you rather question.

[b]Key features[/b]
Answer percentages, user feedback, total answers given, maybe a progress bar for how many questions left. Depending on what we learn in this class and what I need to implement, I may have the number of questions set but have it randomized or allow people to save their progress if there are too many questions. I'm also thinking of having the answer box colors randomized. Other ideas I could potentially implement are friend codes or groups so that you can see what answers were chosen by people you know.

I created prototype images on ninjamock which makes you upgrade to export so here is the link to view them. https://ninjamock.com/s/KMLTVKx

# startup
Would you Rather

I should record different would you rather questions here

Would you rather Only taste Spicy Food or Only taste Sour Food?

Would you rather Sleep All Day or Party All Night?

Some things learned from the GitHub assignment:
1) commit -am is amazing! not having to type add . is great
2) I've never dealt with a merge conflict before so that was cool
especially since my wife deals with them for work

I don't know if I should be keeping the previous stuff so for now I'll leave it.
